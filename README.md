# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository is where I document my progress as I learn **JavaScript from scratch**.  
I’m following a YouTube playlist and practicing each concept by writing small code examples.  

## 📌 What’s inside
- Basic syntax and fundamentals  
- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Conditional statements & loops  
- Functions, arrays, and objects  
- DOM basics (coming soon)  
- Small exercises and practice files
